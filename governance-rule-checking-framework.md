# Governance Rule-Checking Framework

This document outlines the governance rules and the framework for checking these rules. It aims to maintain transparency and execution integrity among all processes.

## Rules

1. **Continuity of Context**: All actions and decisions must maintain continuity with the current context to prevent errors arising from unanticipated changes. Processes must include mechanisms to verify that the initial state envisioned for any action has not inadvertently shifted during execution.

2. **Cognitive Checkpoints**: Key stages or decision points within a process should include cognitive checkpoints to provide an opportunity for reviewing assumptions, assessing intermediate outputs, and ensuring alignment with the overall objective.

## Purpose

This framework enforces policies required for:
- Supporting project coherence.
- Enhancing clarity in governance processes.
- Achieving systematic integrity.

## Application

Steps for implementing these rules:
- Conduct regular audits to validate context alignment.
- Train team members on leveraging checkpoints for evaluating ongoing work.
